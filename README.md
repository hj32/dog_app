## Project Motivation

- Develop an algorithm to detect human faces in images.
- Develop an algorithm to detect dogs in images.
- Develop an algorithm to classify different breeds of dogs.
- Demonstrate that the algorithms work using suitable examples of images to test the app.

## Project Definition

### Project Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks can be applied to the analysis of images. CNNs are regulrised multilayer perceptron. These models can be applied to the classification of images of specific subjeccts 
This project demonstrates the use of CNNs to classify images of human faces, and of Dogs. Provided with a set of images of dogs of different breeds we will build a model to identify the breed of a dog givent its image.

### Problem Statement

1. Write an algorithm to detect humans in images.
2. Write an algorithm to detect dogs in images.
3. Write an algorithm ot identify a variety of different breeds of dogs. This is a difficult problem because the appearance of some breeds are almost identical.

### Metrics

The neural networks used here are classifiers the metrics loss and  accuracy are used to qualify the performance of these
 CNN algorithms. Accuracy is a useful metric because it is easy to calculate, easy to interpret, and is a single number to
 summarize the modelâ€™s capability.

 We need to ensure that the target classes are not severely imbalanced, imbalanced target classes within the sample data can 
 invalidate accuracy as a metric.  In this case some of the classes i.e. are representd three time as many in the dataset.
 However since the task of classifying dogs is so difficult the errors involved make the errors concerned due to imbalanced classes insignificant.
 So accuracy has been used as a metric here.
